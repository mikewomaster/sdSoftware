install reflector.
disconnect internet connection.
use the serial generated from the kg to register the software.
The prog should tell you "unable to connect..". THAT's OK!!!
Use "Activate Manually" option.
Copy the activation code from the program to kg (with CTRl+C/CTRL+V)
Wait till the kg computes the activation response code and paste it back to the program activation window.
THAT IS. you have activated reflector 9.x.

Enjoy!
